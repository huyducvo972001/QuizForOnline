                        team. Interviewing/screening CV is not new to me. I have done that for several years and
                        I can't remember how many CVs I reviewed. Screening CV is an interesting activity (and
                        challenging of course) and I don't ...

                        When it comes to select a company to work for, specifically in software development or
                        software testing, this is one of the most asked questions: Which is better: Outsourcing
